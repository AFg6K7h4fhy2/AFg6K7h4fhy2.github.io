Since roughly Q2 2023, I've been working as a Data Scientist at the [Centers for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html) under [Dylan H. Morris](https://dylanhmorris.com/) on the Short Term Forecasts team. 

I was trained in [Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) and [Neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) (my majors) at Oberlin College.

There are many other things I enjoy thinking about besides infectious disease modelling, but if I had to choose three they would be: forecasting, genetic engineering, and AI. 

Feel free to contact me via email or by making an issue on this [repository](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/AFg6K7h4fhy2.github.io).
