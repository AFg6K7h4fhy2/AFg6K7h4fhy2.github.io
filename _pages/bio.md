At this time in my life, many of my waking hours are spent working on [compartmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) and renewal models for infectious disease modelling (primarily [influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza) and [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19)) at the [Centers for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html). The team I am on—Short Term Forecasts—is led by [Dylan H. Morris](https://dylanhmorris.com/); colleagues of mine include [Damon Bayer](https://damon.phd/) and [Samuel P. C. Brand](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wnB8pTkAAAAJ). While I am not directly leading this project nor am I responsible for the brunt of the model, a project that is fairly representative of my line of work that is also public is the [Multisignal Epi-Inference repository](https://github.com/CDCgov/multisignal-epi-inference). 

Beyond model-building and facilitating model-repositories, I enjoy thinking about the long-term utility of [forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting) and about how forecasting as a field might change and or mature in the future, especially given progress in [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). Over the next 10-20 years, I hope, within infectious disease modelling, that individuals, communities, and jurisdictions will be afforded robust tools tuned to their characteristics that provide interpretable pathogenic burden expectations (spanning the gamut) and response resources. 

During some of the remainder of my time, I read and maintain my keen interests in [paleontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology) (specifically the [Campanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campanian) and Early [Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene)) and global [catastrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophe_scenarios) [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk) (this latter interest includes a focus on the trajectory of [complex societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_society)). Generally speaking, I often cannot avoid thinking about the [deep past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_time) and the [far future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future) of humanity and [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)—rumination, consisting partially of awe and of a sense of nervousness, on these topics occurs daily. My wish is for _[Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human)_ and [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization) to exist for a long time, with the goal of escaping the [background extinction rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_extinction_rate) (_at the very least_; it is difficult, though, to imagine us continuing as a species for this amount of time), without compromising [moral progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_progress), the promotion of [flourishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flourishing), and the minimization of existential and catastrophic risks. 

With respect to my education, I was trained in [Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) and [Neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) (my majors) at Oberlin College. I have not been trained at the graduate level, though I expect I may pursue these studies (likely in either [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), or [Computational Genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_genomics)) in the next 15 years. For other life goals, I would like to have and raise children and also desire to extend the edge of human knowledge, though I am performing abysmally on this front.
